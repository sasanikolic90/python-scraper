# python-scraper
A website scraper written in Python.

In order to have a better chance of scoring a good deal on a bike at an outlet price, I created this script. 
Instead of refreshing the outlet page of the bike manufacturer manuallly, the script notifies you by email every half an hour about the available bikes.

@todo Notify me only when the content of the site changes.
